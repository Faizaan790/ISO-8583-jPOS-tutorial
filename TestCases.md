When transaction processing times exceed 10 seconds
And the number of delayed transactions surpasses 1000
Then the switch should activate its stand-in processing mode
And use cached account data for transaction decisions
And limit transaction approvals to a maximum of $500
And notify the risk management team of the situation
```

### 15.4.2 Fraud Detection System Unavailability

#### Scenario: Fraud detection system is offline
```gherkin
Given a high-value transaction is being processed
When the switch attempts to perform a fraud check
And the fraud detection system is unavailable
Then the switch should apply predefined offline rules
And approve transactions below $100 automatically
And decline transactions above $1000 automatically
And queue transactions between $100 and $1000 for manual review
And alert the fraud team of the system outage
```

#### Scenario: Delayed response from fraud detection system
```gherkin
Given a transaction is being processed
When the switch sends a request to the fraud detection system
And the response time exceeds 5 seconds
Then the switch should proceed with the transaction based on historical risk scores
And flag the transaction for post-processing review
And log the delayed response for system performance monitoring
```

### 15.4.3 Payment Network Disconnection

#### Scenario: Visa network connection is down
```gherkin
Given a Visa card transaction is being processed
When the switch attempts to route the transaction to Visa
And the Visa network connection is unavailable
Then the switch should queue Visa transactions for later processing
And send a "Service Temporarily Unavailable" message to the merchant
And attempt to re-establish connection every 2 minutes
And switch to a backup Visa network connection if available
And notify the network operations team of the outage
```

#### Scenario: All payment network connections are down
```gherkin
Given multiple payment network connections (Visa, Mastercard, Amex) are being monitored
When all network connections become unavailable simultaneously
Then the switch should activate its offline stand-in processing mode
And limit transaction approvals to a maximum of $50
And queue all transactions above $50 for later processing
And send alerts to the IT operations, risk management, and executive teams
And initiate the business continuity plan if the outage exceeds 30 minutes
```

## 15.5 Data Inconsistency Scenarios

### Scenario: Mismatch between authorization and clearing amounts
```gherkin
Given a transaction has been authorized for $100
When the clearing request comes in for $150
And the difference exceeds the allowed threshold of 20%
Then the switch should flag the transaction for review
And notify the merchant services team of the discrepancy
And process the transaction for the authorized amount of $100
And log the incident for chargeback/dispute handling
```

### Scenario: Duplicate transaction detection
```gherkin
Given a customer has made a purchase at a merchant
When the same transaction details (card number, amount, merchant ID, timestamp) are received again within 5 minutes
Then the switch should identify this as a potential duplicate
And decline the second transaction with a "Duplicate Transaction" code
And notify the merchant of the declined duplicate
And log the incident for fraud pattern analysis
```

## 15.6 Unusual Transaction Patterns

### Scenario: Rapid successive transactions on a single card
```gherkin
Given a credit card is being monitored for activity
When more than 5 transactions occur within a 10-minute window
And the transactions are from different geographic locations
Then the fraud detection system should flag the account for potential compromise
And decline any further transactions on the card
And send an immediate alert to the cardholder via SMS and email
And notify the fraud investigation team for manual review
```

### Scenario: Unusual transaction amount for the merchant category
```gherkin
Given a merchant is categorized as a fast food restaurant
When a transaction for $500 is received from this merchant
And this amount is 10 times higher than the average transaction for this category
Then the switch should flag the transaction as suspicious
And request additional verification (e.g., PIN or 3D Secure)
And notify the risk assessment team for review
And log the transaction for pattern analysis
```

## 15.7 System Overload Scenarios

### Scenario: Transaction volume exceeds system capacity
```gherkin
Given the switch is processing transactions at peak capacity
When the incoming transaction rate exceeds 5000 transactions per second
And the processing time for each transaction starts to increase
Then the system should activate its overload protection mode
And prioritize certain transaction types (e.g., ATM withdrawals, essential services)
And queue lower priority transactions for later processing
And send "System Busy" responses for non-critical transactions
And alert the capacity planning team to scale up resources
```

### Scenario: Database connection pool exhaustion
```gherkin
Given the switch is processing transactions normally
When all available database connections are in use
And a new transaction requires a database connection
Then the system should queue the transaction for 5 seconds
And attempt to acquire a connection again after the wait
And if still unsuccessful, respond with a "System Temporarily Unavailable" message
And log the database connection pool exhaustion event
And alert the database administration team to investigate and possibly increase the connection pool size
```

# 16. Performance Testing

Performance testing is crucial for ensuring that CapitalOne's banking switch terminal can handle the expected load and maintain responsiveness under various conditions. The following scenarios cover different aspects of performance testing:

## 16.1 High Volume Transaction Processing

### Scenario: Peak hour transaction processing
```gherkin
Feature: Peak Hour Transaction Processing

  Background:
    Given the banking switch terminal is operational
    And historical data shows peak transaction hours between 12 PM and 2 PM

  Scenario: Process high volume of transactions during peak hours
    Given it is 12:30 PM on a typical business day
    When 10,000 transactions are submitted within a 5-minute window
    Then all transactions should be processed successfully
    And the average response time should be less than 2 seconds
    And no more than 0.1% of transactions should timeout
    And the system resource utilization should not exceed 80%

  Scenario: Maintain performance during sustained high volume
    Given it is the peak hour period
    When an average of 1,000 transactions per minute are processed for 2 hours
    Then the system should maintain a consistent throughput
    And the average response time should not increase by more than 10%
    And no transactions should be lost or duplicated
```

### Scenario: Black Friday shopping surge
```gherkin
Feature: Black Friday Transaction Surge

  Background:
    Given it is Black Friday
    And historical data shows a 300% increase in transaction volume

  Scenario: Handle sudden spike in online transactions
    When the transaction rate increases from 100 per second to 500 per second within 5 minutes
    Then the system should scale resources automatically
    And maintain an average response time of less than 3 seconds
    And successfully process 99.9% of all transactions

  Scenario: Process high volume of in-store transactions
    Given 50,000 physical stores are participating in Black Friday sales
    When the average transaction rate reaches 10 per second per store
    Then the system should process all transactions without queuing
    And maintain an average authorization time of less than 1 second
```

## 16.2 Concurrent User Load Testing

### Scenario: Multiple user types accessing the system simultaneously
```gherkin
Feature: Concurrent User Access

  Background:
    Given the banking switch terminal is connected to multiple channels
    And various user types can access the system

  Scenario: Handle peak concurrent users across channels
    When 1,000,000 individual customers are accessing their accounts via mobile app
    And 500,000 customers are making online purchases
    And 100,000 merchants are processing in-store transactions
    And 10,000 customer service representatives are accessing customer information
    Then the system should remain responsive for all user types
    And no user should experience a response time greater than 5 seconds
    And the error rate should remain below 0.01%

  Scenario: Manage mixed transaction types under heavy load
    Given the system is experiencing peak concurrent usage
    When 40% of transactions are balance inquiries
    And 30% are purchase authorizations
    And 20% are fund transfers
    And 10% are bill payments
    Then each transaction type should be processed within its SLA
    And no transaction type should adversely affect the performance of others
```

## 16.3 Response Time Measurement

### Scenario: Monitor response times for critical transactions
```gherkin
Feature: Transaction Response Time Monitoring

  Background:
    Given the banking switch terminal has defined SLAs for different transaction types

  Scenario Outline: Verify response times for various transaction types
    When a <transaction_type> is initiated
    Then the response time should be less than <max_response_time> seconds
    And 95% of transactions should be faster than <95th_percentile_time> seconds

    Examples:
      | transaction_type     | max_response_time | 95th_percentile_time |
      | balance inquiry      | 1                 | 0.8                  |
      | purchase authorization | 2               | 1.5                  |
      | fund transfer        | 3                 | 2                    |
      | bill payment         | 3                 | 2                    |

  Scenario: Monitor response time degradation
    Given the system is under normal load
    When the load increases by 50% over 30 minutes
    Then the average response time should not increase by more than 20%
    And no individual transaction should take more than 5 seconds to process
```

## 16.4 Database Performance

### Scenario: Database query optimization
```gherkin
Feature: Database Query Performance

  Background:
    Given the banking switch terminal relies on a database for transaction processing

  Scenario: Optimize frequently used queries
    When the top 10 most frequent queries are identified
    Then each query should execute in less than 100 milliseconds
    And the query execution plan should not involve full table scans

  Scenario: Handle complex join operations
    Given a transaction requires data from multiple tables
    When a query involving 5 table joins is executed
    Then the query should complete in less than 500 milliseconds
    And the result set should be returned within 1 second
```

## 16.5 Batch Processing Performance

### Scenario: End-of-day batch processing
```gherkin
Feature: Batch Processing Performance

  Background:
    Given the banking switch terminal performs end-of-day batch processing

  Scenario: Complete daily settlement within the maintenance window
    When the end-of-day batch process is initiated
    Then all transactions for the day should be settled
    And the process should complete within a 4-hour window
    And it should not impact the performance of real-time transactions

  Scenario: Handle month-end processing surge
    Given it is the last day of the month
    When the month-end batch process runs concurrently with daily settlement
    Then both processes should complete within a 6-hour window
    And the system should maintain 99% uptime for critical services
```

## 16.6 Network Performance

### Scenario: Measure network latency and throughput
```gherkin
Feature: Network Performance Monitoring

  Background:
    Given the banking switch terminal communicates with multiple external systems

  Scenario: Monitor inter-system communication performance
    When 1000 messages are sent to the Visa network
    And 1000 messages are sent to the Mastercard network
    Then the average round-trip time should be less than 300 milliseconds
    And the message throughput should exceed 500 messages per second

  Scenario: Handle network congestion
    Given a simulated 50% reduction in network bandwidth
    When normal transaction volume is maintained
    Then the system should prioritize critical transactions
    And maintain an average response time within 150% of normal conditions
```

## 16.7 Stress Testing

### Scenario: System behavior under extreme load
```gherkin
Feature: System Stress Testing

  Background:
    Given the banking switch terminal is operating at peak capacity

  Scenario: Exceed maximum designed load
    When the transaction volume is increased to 200% of the designed maximum load
    Then the system should continue to process transactions without data loss
    And automatically queue low-priority transactions
    And maintain critical services with degraded performance

  Scenario: Recover from overload condition
    Given the system has been under 200% load for 1 hour
    When the load returns to normal levels
    Then the system should clear all transaction backlogs within 30 minutes
    And return to normal performance levels within 1 hour
```

# 17. Security Testing

## 17.1 Encryption/Decryption Processes

### 17.1.1 Data in Transit Encryption

```gherkin
Feature: Data in Transit Encryption

Scenario: Secure transmission of card data during authorization
  Given a customer initiates a transaction at a POS terminal
  When the card data is transmitted to the CapitalOne switch
  Then the data should be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher
  And the encrypted data should not be readable if intercepted

Scenario: Secure transmission of sensitive data between internal systems
  Given the switch needs to communicate with the core banking system
  When sensitive customer data is transmitted
  Then the data should be encrypted using AES-256
  And the encryption keys should be rotated regularly

Scenario: Handling of unencrypted data
  Given an external system attempts to send unencrypted data
  When the switch receives the transmission
  Then it should reject the connection
  And log the attempt as a security event
```

### 17.1.2 Data at Rest Encryption

```gherkin
Feature: Data at Rest Encryption

Scenario: Storage of card data in the database
  Given card data needs to be stored for transaction processing
  When the data is written to the database
  Then the sensitive fields should be encrypted using field-level encryption
  And the encryption keys should be stored in a separate, secure key management system

Scenario: Retrieval of encrypted data
  Given an authorized process needs to access encrypted card data
  When the data is retrieved from the database
  Then it should be decrypted only when necessary
  And the decryption should occur in a secure memory space

Scenario: Encryption key rotation
  Given the regular key rotation schedule is due
  When the key rotation process is initiated
  Then all affected data should be re-encrypted with the new key
  And the old key should be securely destroyed after a grace period
```

## 17.2 Key Management Procedures

### 17.2.1 Key Generation and Storage

```gherkin
Feature: Key Generation and Storage

Scenario: Generation of new encryption keys
  Given a new encryption key is required
  When the key generation process is initiated
  Then the key should be generated using a FIPS 140-2 compliant random number generator
  And the key should meet or exceed the required bit strength for its intended use

Scenario: Secure storage of encryption keys
  Given a newly generated encryption key
  When the key is stored
  Then it should be stored in a FIPS 140-2 compliant Hardware Security Module (HSM)
  And access to the HSM should require multi-factor authentication

Scenario: Backup of encryption keys
  Given the need to backup encryption keys
  When the backup process is initiated
  Then the keys should be securely exported using a key wrapping technique
  And the wrapped keys should be stored in multiple secure, geographically separated locations
```

### 17.2.2 Key Usage and Rotation

```gherkin
Feature: Key Usage and Rotation

Scenario: Monitoring key usage
  Given an encryption key is in active use
  When the key is used for encryption or decryption operations
  Then each use should be logged with a timestamp and the process that used it
  And alerts should be generated if usage patterns deviate from the norm

Scenario: Scheduled key rotation
  Given a key has been in use for the maximum allowed time period
  When the key rotation process is triggered
  Then a new key should be generated and put into service
  And all new encryptions should use the new key
  And a process should be initiated to re-encrypt existing data with the new key

Scenario: Emergency key rotation
  Given a potential compromise of an encryption key is detected
  When the emergency key rotation process is initiated
  Then a new key should be immediately generated and put into service
  And all systems using the potentially compromised key should be updated
  And all data encrypted with the old key should be re-encrypted as a priority
```

## 17.3 Access Control Verification

### 17.3.1 User Authentication

```gherkin
Feature: User Authentication

Scenario: Multi-factor authentication for system access
  Given a user attempts to log into the switch terminal system
  When they enter their username and password
  Then they should be prompted for a second factor of authentication
  And access should only be granted if both factors are verified

Scenario: Failed login attempts
  Given a user enters incorrect login credentials
  When they fail to authenticate three times in succession
  Then their account should be temporarily locked
  And an alert should be sent to the security team

Scenario: Password complexity requirements
  Given a user is setting or changing their password
  When they enter a new password
  Then the system should enforce minimum complexity requirements
  And reject passwords that don't meet the criteria
```

### 17.3.2 Role-Based Access Control

```gherkin
Feature: Role-Based Access Control

Scenario: Assigning user roles
  Given a new employee joins the CapitalOne switch terminal team
  When their user account is created
  Then they should be assigned a role based on their job function
  And their access permissions should be limited to what's necessary for their role

Scenario: Modifying user roles
  Given an employee changes positions within the company
  When their role needs to be updated
  Then their old permissions should be revoked
  And new permissions should be granted based on their new role
  And the change should be logged for audit purposes

Scenario: Temporary elevation of privileges
  Given a user needs temporary additional access for a specific task
  When a request for elevated privileges is approved
  Then the user should be granted the additional access for a limited time period
  And all actions taken with elevated privileges should be closely monitored
  And the elevated access should be automatically revoked after the specified time period
```

### 17.3.3 System and API Access Control

```gherkin
Feature: System and API Access Control

Scenario: API authentication
  Given an external system attempts to access the switch terminal API
  When the API request is received
  Then the system should require valid API credentials
  And the credentials should be verified against the allowed list of external systems

Scenario: Rate limiting API access
  Given an authenticated system is making API calls
  When the number of calls exceeds the defined threshold in a given time period
  Then further requests should be throttled
  And an alert should be generated for potential API abuse

Scenario: Monitoring system interconnections
  Given the switch terminal system interfaces with multiple internal and external systems
  When data is exchanged between systems
  Then all interconnections should be monitored for unusual patterns
  And any unauthorized connection attempts should be blocked and logged
```

### 17.4.1 Regular Security Scans

```gherkin
Feature: Regular Security Scans

Scenario: Automated vulnerability scanning
  Given the regular security scan schedule
  When the automated scanning tool is run
  Then it should check for known vulnerabilities in all system components
  And generate a report of any found vulnerabilities with severity ratings

Scenario: Manual penetration testing
  Given the annual security assessment is due
  When the external penetration testing team conducts their assessment
  Then they should attempt to exploit any potential vulnerabilities
  And provide a detailed report of their findings and recommendations

Scenario: Addressing identified vulnerabilities
  Given a vulnerability has been identified in the system
  When the vulnerability is confirmed and assessed
  Then a patch or mitigation strategy should be developed and tested
  And the fix should be applied within the timeframe specified by the security policy
```

### 17.4.2 Secure Configuration Management

```gherkin
Feature: Secure Configuration Management

Scenario: Hardening system configurations
  Given a new server is being set up for the switch terminal system
  When the operating system and software are installed
  Then all unnecessary services and ports should be disabled
  And security configurations should be applied according to industry best practices

Scenario: Regular configuration audits
  Given the monthly configuration audit schedule
  When the audit process is run
  Then it should compare current configurations against the approved baseline
  And any deviations should be flagged for review and remediation

Scenario: Change management for security configurations
  Given a change to the system configuration is proposed
  When the change request is submitted
  Then it should be reviewed by the security team
  And the potential security impact should be assessed before approval
```

## 17.5 Incident Response and Forensics

### 17.5.1 Security Incident Detection

```gherkin
Feature: Security Incident Detection

Scenario: Real-time threat detection
  Given the security information and event management (SIEM) system is active
  When suspicious activity is detected
  Then an alert should be generated and sent to the security team
  And automated response procedures should be initiated if applicable

Scenario: User reporting of security incidents
  Given a user notices suspicious activity
  When they report it through the designated channel
  Then the incident response team should be notified immediately
  And the report should be logged and prioritized for investigation

Scenario: Correlation of security events
  Given multiple low-level security events are detected
  When the SIEM system analyzes the events
  Then it should correlate related events
  And escalate the combined events if they indicate a potential larger threat
```

### 17.5.2 Incident Response Procedures

```gherkin
Feature: Incident Response Procedures

Scenario: Initiating the incident response plan
  Given a security incident has been confirmed
  When the incident response plan is activated
  Then the appropriate team members should be notified and assembled
  And initial containment measures should be implemented

Scenario: Evidence collection and preservation
  Given an active security incident
  When digital evidence needs to be collected
  Then forensically sound methods should be used to collect and preserve the evidence
  And a clear chain of custody should be maintained

Scenario: Post-incident review
  Given a security incident has been resolved
  When the post-incident review is conducted
  Then the team should analyze the incident's cause and the effectiveness of the response
  And recommendations for preventing similar incidents should be documented and implemented
```
